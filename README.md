**Introduction**

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict car prices based on features like make, model, year, mileage, and more. The goal is to provide accurate price estimates for car buyers and sellers.

**Problem Statement**

Car pricing is complex, influenced by multiple factors. Traditional methods often fall short, so this project uses data-driven approaches to improve prediction accuracy.

**Data Collection**

The dataset was sourced from online listings, automotive databases, and sales records, including features like:

.Make/Model

.Year

.Mileage

.Engine Size

.Fuel Type

.Transmission

**Data Preprocessing**

Data cleaning included handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalizing/encoding features to prepare for modeling.

**Model Development**

Implemented and trained models such as:

.Linear Regression

.Random Forest

.Gradient Boosting

.Training involved an 80/20 train-test split, with cross-validation to ensure accuracy.

**Model Evaluation**

Evaluated models using:

.Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

.R-squared (RÂ²)

.The Gradient Boosting model performed best with the lowest MAE and highest R-squared value.

**Deployment**

A simple user interface was developed for inputting car features to get price predictions. Future work may include adding more features or experimenting with deep learning models.

**Conclusion**

The project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can accurately predict car prices, aiding decision-making for buyers and sellers.
